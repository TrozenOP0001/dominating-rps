# dominating-rps

Dominating RPS — a futuristic, tech-minimalist Rock-Paper-Scissors game ready for GitHub Pages.
This project includes:
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — styles
- `script.js` — game logic (power-ups, shops, daily rewards, achievements, levels, audio, particles)
- Local save/export/import & local leaderboard

## How to deploy (GitHub Pages)

1. Create a GitHub repository (public).
2. Upload the files from this project (make sure `index.html` is at the root).
3. Settings → Pages → Branch `main` → `/ (root)` and Save.
4. Open `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` to play.

## Notes & Mobile autoplay

The game will attempt to autoplay a light background synth on page load. Some mobile browsers **may require** a user gesture to unlock audio — most will allow autoplay but if it doesn't, tap any button to enable audio.
